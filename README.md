# Sticky-notes
## History
Originally built with Tkinter in January 2025, this project was fully rewritten in February 2026 using PySide6 as a way to learn the library, based on its official documentation. Although it was created for personal use and later replaced by Windows Sticky Notes, the project was remastered for fun and educational purposes.
